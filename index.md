## Introduction

Hello fellow CSE 110 classmates! I'm Nathan, a 3<sup>rd</sup> year Math-CS major in Warren College. I'm originally from Irvine, so SoCal is an area I'm very familar with. I'm really excited to take this class as I think it'll be really helpful for my future career (I'm sure many of us want to be software engineers in the future, or at least *something* similar). By the way, I'm also taking
- [x] CSE 130
- [ ] MATH 173A

and I would be down to study with anyone else who is also in either of those classes.

## Me as a Programmer

So to be honest, I don't have much experience with programming outside of the classes here at UCSD. Although I've been fairly successful in the previous CSE courses, I am unsure how well that will translate to this class. Regardless, I am always ready to learned new techinques and skills that will help me improve as a programmer. Just for fun, I'd say my 3 best programming languages (in order) are:
1. Java
2. C++
3. Python

## Me as a Person

Outside of school, I enjoy doing a wide variety of things. Firstly, I love exploring San Diego and its neighboring areas. I always like going to the beach for either bonfires or relaxing, and occassionally I'll go into the water. Aside from the beach, eating out at many of the different restuarants nearby is something that never gets old for me. If I just want to stay at home and do something, I can always join a Discord call with friends and play some games on the Switch (my friend code is `2584-1425-5804` if you wanna add me). Specifically, we play a lot of [*Super Smash Bros. Ultimate*](https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/index.html), and I've gotten quite good at it (I'm even on the school's eSports team for it). Aside from video games, a few other things I can list off that I like doing are:
- working out
- playing table tennis
- bowling
- rock climbing

~~although I'm still really bad at all of those~~. If any of those sound like something you'd also wanna do, feel free to DM me on Slack.
